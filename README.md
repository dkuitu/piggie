PHP lab for special topic

Piggie
Piggie is a PHP lab for a special topic. This repository includes a collection of PHP and Python files that serve as the back-end for a game. The project primarily uses PHP, making up 74.6% of the code, with Python accounting for the remaining 25.4%.

Structure
The repository consists of various PHP and Python scripts:

play.php: A PHP script that interacts with the game's database to play the game.
purchase.php: A PHP script that interacts with the game's database to manage purchases within the game.
start_game.php: A PHP script to start a new game.
test_redis.php: A PHP script to test the connectivity with Redis.
database.php: A PHP script for managing the database connection.
login.php: A PHP script for managing user login.
redis.php: A PHP script for managing the connection to Redis.
sim.py: A Python script that interacts with the game's server.
stats.py: A Python script for performing computations related to the game.
Usage
To use these scripts, you'll need a server that can run PHP, a SQL database, and Python3 installed. The server should also be connected to Redis. You might need to adjust the database and Redis connection details in the PHP scripts.

Please note that this repository is a lab exercise and may not function as a complete game without further modification or integration with a front-end user interface.
